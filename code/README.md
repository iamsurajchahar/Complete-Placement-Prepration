# Code For Extracting Hyperlinks

This code was used to extract the hyperlinks from the PDFs and convert them into markdown files. You are free to test them out!

Requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

Note - This only extracts the hyperlinks and the rest of the work has to be done manually

Steps to recreate what I did - 
1) Open the PDF file and copy its contents
2) Paste it into a markdown file of the same name
3) Remove the title and the footer
4) Run the script by changing the file name at the beginning
5) Make changes as you feel appropriate

You are good to go!
